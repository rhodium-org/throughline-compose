"""Publication coverage is judged over the union, not left inert (SR-0038).

Core's validator does not read the published documents for itself — `check` reads
them and hands the set in, and a caller that omits it gets `published=None`, which
the rule reads as "not configured" and stays silent. `tl-compose check` omitted it,
so a composed project could configure `[docs] paths`, watch both gates pass, and be
told nothing. These tests hold the rule from both ends: it fires on a local item the
documents do not name, and it goes quiet when they do — because a rule that only
ever passes is indistinguishable from one that was never asked.
