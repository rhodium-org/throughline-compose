"""A listing answers over the composed graph and states its scope (SR-0037).

The fixture is the smallest graph that tells the two scopes apart: the consumer
holds an intent and a system requirement, and the toy source holds an intent, a
*user* requirement — a type the consumer has none of — and a system requirement.
So a filter on `user_requirement` is the reported defect in miniature: the answer
is one item, and a local-only listing reports zero without saying so.

Both halves of the requirement are held here. The capability, that a borrowed
clause can be found at all and is named as the composer names it; and the
statement of scope, which is the half that matters under either design, because a
count that does not say what it counted is a wrong answer rather than a narrow one.
