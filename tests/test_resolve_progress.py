"""SR-0031 — a source being fetched announces itself before the fetch, not after.

Cloning a pinned source is the only slow thing composition does, and it happens
before any checking has begun, so a first run against an unfetched source used to
sit silent for the whole of it — the defect UR-0009 names. The obligation is about
*ordering* and *when it stays quiet*, so the tests pin both: the notice precedes the
clone, and a warm cache says nothing at all.
