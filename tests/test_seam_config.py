"""A consumer may widen the seam for its own rules (SR-0035).

The seam allowlist keys on the rule *name*, and a rule name does not say where the
remedy for a finding lies. A coverage rule the consumer itself declared is answered
by authoring an item in the consumer, so it is not the class SR-0026 suppresses —
but only the project that wrote the rule can say that. These tests hold both halves:
the default stays exactly as SR-0026 alone defines it, and a declaration is honoured
without ever being able to narrow the seam.
