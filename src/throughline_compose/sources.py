"""Declared external sources (SR-0001, SR-0002, SR-0006, SR-0045).

A consuming project names the throughline sources it composes in an array of
``[[sources]]`` tables in its ``throughline.toml``. Each entry binds an
importer-chosen *namespace* (SR-0001) to a standalone throughline source whose UIDs
are its own (SR-0002). Clauses are then referenced from the consumer as
``<namespace>:<UID>``.

A source is located one of two ways (SR-0006):

- ``url`` + ``ref`` — a git origin pinned to an edition (normally a tag). The
  durable, shareable form; resolved into a per-user cache by ``resolve.py``.
- ``path`` — a local directory, for developing a source and its consumer side by
  side.

The two are mutually exclusive; a ``url`` without a ``ref`` is rejected so a
dependency can never silently track a moving default. Either form may carry an
optional ``subdir`` (SR-0008) naming a directory, relative to the fetched
repository root (or the local ``path``), that holds the throughline project — so a
graph living under a subpath of a larger repo is a first-class source.

Composing a source composes what it composes (SR-0045): every source a declared
source itself declares reaches the union, to any depth, under the label its
declaring source gave it. The consumer's one lever over those labels is an
optional ``alias`` table on the declared source, mapping a label used anywhere
beneath that source to a namespace of the consumer's choosing. The ``reexport``
key that SR-0014 introduced is withdrawn: in the consumer's own configuration it
is refused with a pointer to ``alias``; inside a source's configuration it is
ignored, so an edition published with the key stays composable.

This module is pure config parsing — it does not fetch or load anything.
