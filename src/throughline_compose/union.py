"""Build one throughline graph from a consumer plus its declared sources (SR-0004).

The core throughline validator is reused *unchanged* (SR-0004): rather than teach
`tl` about namespaces, `tl-compose` folds every source's items into a single union
:class:`~throughline.model.Project` and runs the ordinary `validate` over it. The
one trick is identity. A source's UIDs are its own (SR-0002), so two sources — or a
source and the consumer — may both hold ``SR-0001``. Before merging, each borrowed
UID is *mangled* to a synthetic prefix derived from its namespace (``gds:SR-0001``
→ ``GDSSR-0001``), so the union has globally-unique, grammar-valid UIDs. Every
namespace-qualified reference (SR-0001) and every source-internal reference is
rewritten to the mangled form, so the graph resolves with no colons left.

Findings from the core are then translated back: mangled UIDs in a finding's target
and message become their original ``<namespace>:<UID>`` form, so the composer reads
diagnostics in the vocabulary they wrote.
