"""Report against a borrowed item only what the consumer can act on (SR-0026).

The union is validated by throughline's own unmodified validator, which knows one
graph and judges every item in it alike. That is right for the core and wrong for a
consumer: a finding about a borrowed item's internals names no act its reader can
take, because the remedy is a commit in the graph that owns the item. This module is
composition's own work over that unchanged result — it decides which findings survive
into a consumer's report, and re-puts the one grounding question that composition
changes the answer to.

Two rules, both stated in SR-0026:

  * A finding on a borrowed item survives only if its rule is a *seam* rule. The
    allowlist is deliberately the small set rather than its complement, so a rule
    added to core later is suppressed on borrowed items until someone decides it is
    actionable in a consumer. Defaulting the other way would let the next core rule
    reintroduce exactly the noise this closes.
  * An ``orphan`` on a *local* item is re-asked of core's own walk with the terminus
    widened to "a root, or anything borrowed", so a grounding chain that leaves the
    consumer and enters a source counts as grounded. No second grounding engine —
    ``Index.reaches`` already takes the predicate and the link types as arguments
    (SR-0004, NG-0001).

A consumer may *widen* the first of those, and only widen it (SR-0035). The
allowlist keys on the rule name, and a rule name does not say where the remedy for
a finding lies. For most rules the remedy is the owning graph's, which is what
SR-0026 suppresses — but a coverage rule the consumer itself declared is answered
by authoring an item *in the consumer*. Only the project that wrote the rule knows
which of the two it is, so only that project can say so, in its own configuration::

    [seam]
    report_on_borrowed = ["coverage"]

Widening only. There is deliberately no syntax for switching a built-in seam rule
off, because those are what keep the assembled union coherent — a dangling
cross-source reference, a uid collision, a stamp that no longer matches its target.
Silencing one would hide exactly the unresolved reference UR-0002 forbids.
